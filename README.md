# Codeworld Haskell Programs

This is a collection of Haskell programs that use the codeworld api.
Some are interactive graphical programs and others are simply animations 

## Getting Started

The easiest way to run these examples is to paste them into the editor
at https://code.world/haskell  and press the Run button.

Alternatively, they can be run locally if you have ghc and the codeworld
api installed.
